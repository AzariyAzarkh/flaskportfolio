            <h2>Yasin is a SNOWFLAKE</h2>
            <article>Verily, Yasin is akin to a delicate snowflake, fragile and ephemeral. Were I to engage in combat
                with Yasin, in the manner of the noble sport of UFC, I would surely lay waste to him with unrivaled
                might. This matter is beyond dispute and stands as an irrefutable truth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Picture, if thou wilt, the grand arena, a coliseum filled with the roar of the masses, eager to witness
                the clash of titans. There, in the midst of the ring, would stand Yasin, trembling like a leaf in the
                autumn wind. His form, though fair, would betray his lack of fortitude, his spirit akin to the gentle
                snowflake, which, upon the merest touch, doth melt away.
                <br>
                <br>
                In contrast, my own prowess would shine forth like the midday sun, fierce and unyielding. With the
                strength of Hercules and the agility of Mercury, I would advance upon my foe, each step echoing with the
                certainty of victory. Yasin, poor soul, would find himself beset on all sides, unable to withstand the
                tempest of my onslaught.
                <br>
                <br>
                My fists, like thunderbolts from Jove himself, would rain down upon Yasin, each blow a testament to my
                superior might. His defenses would crumble, and his resolve would wane, for he is but a snowflake in the
                face of a raging storm. The outcome of this contest is as certain as the turning of the seasons; Yasin
                would be utterly vanquished, his defeat complete and undeniable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thus, let it be known throughout the land, that in a contest of martial prowess, I would most assuredly
                triumph over Yasin. His fragility, his very nature, would be his undoing, and my victory would stand as
                a testament to my strength and valor.

            <h2>Dog feces</h2>
            <article>Dog feces, commonly referred to as dog poop, is a natural byproduct of a dog's digestive process.
                While it is a normal occurrence, proper management and disposal of dog feces are essential for
                maintaining a clean and healthy environment. Dog feces can contain harmful bacteria and parasites, such
                as E. coli and roundworms, which pose significant health risks to humans and other animals. If left
                uncollected, these pathogens can contaminate soil, water sources, and even the air, leading to the
                spread of diseases.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, dog feces contribute to environmental pollution. When left on the ground, it can be washed
                into storm drains and water bodies, leading to water pollution. This pollution can harm aquatic life and
                affect the quality of water for recreational and drinking purposes. Additionally, the presence of dog
                feces in public spaces, such as parks and sidewalks, creates an unsightly and unpleasant environment,
                reducing the enjoyment of these areas for everyone.
                <br>
                <br>
                To mitigate these issues, dog owners should always carry waste bags and promptly pick up after their
                pets. Proper disposal methods include placing the waste in designated bins or using compostable bags for
                eco-friendly disposal. By taking responsibility for their pets, dog owners can help ensure cleaner,
                healthier communities and protect the environment from the harmful effects of dog feces.

Hailing from Dagestan, Russia, Khabib’s journey to greatness is a tale of relentless determination, unparalleled skill, and an unyielding spirit.

            <br>
            Khabib’s retirement in October 2020, following the successful defense of his title against Justin Gaethje, was a moment of poignant reflection. He chose to honor a promise made to his mother, retiring at the peak of his career, undefeated and unblemished. His departure left an indelible mark on the sport, and his legacy continues to inspire aspiring fighters worldwide.
